## TODO ##

* Since there are multiple cameras in some locations, each graphic should have an array of cameras in a `cameras` attribute.

## Notes ##

This project uses the REST endpoints of the WSDOT Traveler Information API.  The REST endpoints are a new feature which is currently only available in the [QA version of the API](http://webpub3qa.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/api/).
